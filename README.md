Either download DATA_SVM_JV_Preprocessed.csv or start by executing Data Preprocessing once, to execute classification and return calculations.
After preprocessing is done once, and the preprocessed data file exists, SVM_Replication and 2Input_CNN-LSTM can be executed.

SVM_Replication builds, trains and tests a model based on Support Vector machines, 2Input_CNN does the same but for a Neural Network using CNN and LSTM layers.
In both files, some further adjustments are done with the data, e.g. standardization and shapes.

Using Jupyter notebook is highly recommended, when checking different parameter settings.
